  Cof_politics_detail1_key:0 "The Commune of France is a federal syndicalist republic composed of over 36,000 communes. The §YGeneral Confederation of Labour (Bourse Générale du Travail - BGT)§! serves as its legislative body, and is theoretically the highest state organ. Based on France's population distribution and rational industrial divisions,\nwe have ultimately established a 650-seat People's Assembly; all legislation must be passed by the §YGeneral Confederation of Labour§!, and any bill requires at least 326 votes (50% + 1) to be approved.\nThe §YCommittee of Public Safety (Comité de Salut Public - CSP)§! serves as the executive arm of the people’s will. Elections for the §YCSP§! run parallel to those of the §YGeneral Confederation§!, though by tradition, CSP elections are held first. However, since the §YCSP§! can refuse to recognize BGT election results and call for new elections, in practice the highest authority of the Commune lies in the §YCSP§!. Nonetheless, the §YCSP§! remains constrained legislatively by the §YGeneral Confederation§!, and the chairman of the §YBGT§! serves as an important counterbalance to the power of the CSP’s chair. Each CSP representative holds significant sway in their area of governance, but given the Commune functions largely as a union of major cities, local implementation ultimately depends on local leaders.\n\n"
  Cof_politics_detail2_key:0 "\nThe political landscape of the Commune of France in 1936 is complex. The §YRevolutionary Syndicalist Committee (Comité Syndical Révolutionnaire - CSR)§!, which long held power through the §YCGT§!, split from the §YAssociation of Federalist Anarchists (Association des Fédéralistes Anarchistes - AFA)§! following the §Y“CGT Lawsuit”§!. Broadly speaking, internal politics are now divided among the §rSyndicalist Bloc§! led by the §YCSR§!, the §RWorker-Peasant Opposition§! formed by the §YAFA§! and the §YWorker-Peasant Communist Party (Parti Communiste Ouvrier et Paysan)§!, who jointly oppose both authoritarianism and syndicalist establishment, the §YFrench Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste de France)§! centered around §YMarceau Pivert§!, and the §xJacobin Bloc§! composed mostly of technocratic supporters. Lastly, there is the §oSorelian Bloc§!, formed around the §YNational-Syndicalist Confederation (Confédération Nationale-Syndicaliste)§! by revolutionary Georges Sorel.\n"

  Cof_social_class_detail1_key:0 "Even if we have overthrown the rule of the reactionary bourgeoisie, it doesn't mean the people will be perpetually satisfied. Different strata of society still have their own demands, often conflicting with each other. Nevertheless, these various groups are what constitute our nation, and their satisfaction—or dissatisfaction—affects every aspect of our society, from the economy to the military, from politics to culture.\n§g(Average social satisfaction impacts our $MODIFIER_STABILITY_FACTOR$. A class's influence determines what areas it affects and by what multiplier, while its satisfaction affects the actual value.)§!\n"
  Cof_social_class_detail_w_key:0 "$class_pop_workers$ are the greatest beneficiaries of the Commune system and have shown deep political engagement. While most $class_pop_workers$ support the rule of the §YCGT§!, some—particularly those in regions governed by other factions—exhibit strong regionalist tendencies. However, after the §Y“Case Against the CGT”§!, a rift formed within the $class_pop_workers$, especially among those not affiliated with the §YCGT§!, who began to turn toward alternative solutions.\n"
  Cof_social_class_detail_p_key:0 "Many $class_pop_peasants$ harbor little goodwill toward the current communal regime. Due to the obvious favoritism shown to $class_pop_workers$, the $class_pop_peasants$ saw little 'liberation' from the revolution. Combined with the deeply rooted Christian influence in rural France, many $class_pop_peasants$ maintain strong religious sentiments and a reverence for authority. Although France is an industrial power, the $class_pop_peasants$ still make up the majority. The countryside, weary of Parisian contempt, overwhelmingly supports the $faction_oppo$.\n"
  Cof_social_class_detail_m_key:0 "To some, the $class_pop_merchants$ are an element to be 'cleansed.' In truth, however, the pre-revolution progressive $class_pop_merchants$ and some affluent $class_pop_workers$ now form a somewhat 'problematic' group within the Commune. This class is quite broad, encompassing everyone from factory managers to small-town market vendors. Their internal diversity is vast, but overall, they tend to support whatever faction can improve their livelihoods.\n"
  Cof_social_class_detail_s_key:0 "France’s $class_pop_scholars$ have long been a treasure of global thought, and this has only increased after the revolution. With the fall of the bourgeois regime, our $class_pop_scholars$ can finally speak freely—even if what they say doesn't always align with our goals. Composed of professors, students, and cultural workers, they represent the nation's future and often guide its direction. Though their political views are unique, they generally seek change. In a stale society, the $class_pop_scholars$ will inevitably rebel—with pen and paper.\n"
  Cof_social_class_detail_b_key:0 "$class_pop_bureaucrats$ are the backbone of the state's functioning. Without them, implementing any reforms would be near impossible. Yet even under our revolution, the entrenched flaws of the bureaucratic system—corruption, clientelism, and bourgeois-style practices—persist. Though $class_pop_bureaucrats$ are merely executors of our supreme will, they are human after all, with thoughts of their own. Depending on their positions, they may harbor different views, but they all agree on one thing: expanding their own power.\n"
  Cof_social_class_detail_a_key:0 "The $class_pop_army$ is a structured institution. Although soldiers are duty-bound to obey orders, it was their refusal to obey the bourgeoisie's commands that allowed the revolution to succeed. Within the $class_pop_army$ exists a strict hierarchy—$class_pop_army_officers$, $class_pop_army_ncos$, and $class_pop_army_soldiers$—perhaps even harsher than civilian society. Yet the army still believes the Commune is a cause worth dying for... unless, one day, they feel they must save the Republic themselves.\n"
