  Cof_economy_detail1_key:0 "Not everything can be solved simply by declaring revolutionary victory—especially not the economy. Factories do not spring from ruins on their own. With the former Republic ravaged by the Great War, a myriad of economic schools are vying to stain this bleached parchment with their preferred hues. The high degree of local autonomy and the balance of power between political factions has prevented a clear answer from emerging during the years of revolution. But now, the time has come to settle this question once and for all. Without a defined economic system, we cannot safeguard the political fruits of our revolution from enemy hands.\n§gThe Economic Condition (Economic Vitality) reflects the general state of our economy. The better the condition, the greater the benefits we receive—and the more our people will support our leadership.§!\n"
  Cof_economy_detail2_key:0 "\n§gThe Economic Affairs Representative largely reflects the people's will regarding economic matters. Policies supported by them are easier to pass, but going against their stance may cause our reforms to be hindered. Each faction wields its own influence on the economy. While our reform policies can reduce some factions’ power, those with great influence will not yield without resistance.§!\n"

In turn, these activities can influence—and even shift—our economic model. Whether we adopt a flexible hybrid approach or commit firmly to systemic reform, our ultimate goal remains the same: economic growth. Different models offer unique benefits and unlock specific activities, but may also alienate other economic factions. Still, as long as the people benefit from our reforms, they will rally to our cause. Economic vitality affects the effectiveness of the chosen model.§!"
  Cof_economy_detail4_key:0 "\n§gIndustrial level is a fundamental indicator of a nation's economic capacity. Though we inherited factories from the old Republic, our syndicalist model presents an entirely new organizational method of economic management. Since the spinning wheel, machines have played a vital role in production. Our people should not be burdened with meaningless repetitive labor. However, automation may also cause unemployment, leading to discontent. We must find the perfect balance between man and machine—or perhaps not.\n§!"
  Cof_economy_detail5_key:0 "\n§gIf industry is the branch of the economy, then agriculture is its root. Bread must come before ideals and the future. France is a major agricultural country, and this land has birthed countless lives. Many enjoy their food without knowing the hardships of rural life. We have ignored agriculture for too long, until even the silent began to speak. The days of relying on the heavens are over. Mechanization will free up labor from exhausting and inefficient tasks. Chemical fertilizers will raise yields, providing our people with more food. Yet merely selling raw goods will not enrich farmers. By extending the value chain, both our farmers and our economy will thrive.\n"
  Cof_economy_detail6_key:0 "\n§gFrance’s economic activity has historically concentrated in a few major cities—good for greedy businessmen and decadent aristocrats, but not for the people, who have chosen to say no. Economic equality is not just a principle; it is a necessity. No one should suffer in poverty, even after we've declared the revolution a success. The urban-rural divide remains a stark reminder of unfinished work.\nThe industrial and supply chains are vital components of the economy, but our previous disorganized approach has weakened their cohesion, resulting in inefficiency and loss of labor. Fortunately, our reforms can mend this fractured industrial landscape.\nTo many economists, the economy is a static model, blind to the winds of change. That’s why feudalism was surpassed by capitalism—and why socialism must in turn surpass capitalism. Innovation is the truest expression of socialism’s superiority. While capitalists pursue profit, they miss what truly benefits humanity. That, we must deliver.§!"
