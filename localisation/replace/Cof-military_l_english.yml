  Cof_militray_reform_detail1_key:0 "The Federal Army played a vital role in defending the revolution, but in this era of change, various ideological currents have begun to stir within the military itself. Since the end of the Weltkrieg, public enthusiasm for war has steadily declined, and to replenish the army with fresh blood, recruitment has increasingly drawn from aimless 're-employment' candidates. Clearly, these individuals cannot carry the banner of the Commune's military — a reform of the armed forces is imperative. However, such reform is bound to affect society at large, as opinions about the military vary widely. Some even view our army as a 'remnant of oppression' and advocate for its complete dissolution, entrusting national defense to fragile militia units instead.\n\nEven within the military, attitudes toward the Commune's politics vary. As the Chief of the General Staff is an elected position, wielding significant influence over the entire armed structure, we cannot guarantee that the army will remain solely a revolutionary force without interfering in broader societal affairs. In the worst-case scenario, our reform plans might even be vetoed by the military itself.\n"
  Cof_militray_reform_detail2_key:0 "§g$class_pop_officers$ are the senior members of the military, holding substantial authority within a strictly hierarchical structure. They are often composed of seasoned veterans, though some may be theoretical commanders who have never set foot on a battlefield. Due to their knowledge and experience, they can craft detailed plans and assess the development of engagements through simulations.\n§!"
  Cof_militray_reform_detail3_key:0 "§g$class_pop_ncos$ make up the army's middle management. Most $class_pop_ncos$ are promoted from the ranks of $class_pop_soldiers$, possessing frontline combat experience along with some theoretical understanding. While they may not plan large-scale operations like the $class_pop_officers$, it is often their quick thinking in critical moments that turns the tide of battle.\n§!"
  Cof_militray_reform_detail4_key:0 "§g$class_pop_soldiers$ are the most basic units of the army, whose duty is to obey and carry out orders. Yet after our revolution, a new school of thought emerged — one that sees the hierarchical obedience of the army as a form of class oppression. $class_pop_soldiers$ are not thoughtless tools, nor are they pawns to be sacrificed at others' whims. Had it not been for the $class_pop_soldiers$ defying the old republic’s orders, how would our revolution have come to be?\n§!"

  Cof_militray_reform_detail6_key:0 "§gWhether the army serves the state or a political faction cannot be settled by a single sentence in the constitution. An apolitical army may ensure regime stability, yet as the armed embodiment of national will, the military can never truly be free from politics.
